# Python Zero to Hero ðŸš€

This repository contains all the **mini projects and practice tasks** Iâ€™ve completed while learning Python â€” from the very basics to more structured code.  
Each file is focused on applying concepts through hands-on coding.

---

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Day 1: Introduction to Python & Setup
- Day 2: Variables and Data Types
- Day 3: Input and Output
- Day 4: Conditional Statements
- Day 5: Loops (for, while)
- Day 6: Functions
- Day 7: Lists
- Day 8: Dictionaries
- Day 9: Tuples and Sets



---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python 3.13
- VS Code 
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## ðŸ’¡ What's Inside?

Each file contains:
- Practice code based on daily topics
- Mini-project(s) demonstrating how the concept is applied
- Simple, readable structured codes

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

I'll continue adding:
- File handling projects
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) examples
- Error handling mini apps
- Real-world inspired Python challenges

---

## ðŸ§  Goal

Build a solid foundation in Python by **coding daily**, not just reading theory.
